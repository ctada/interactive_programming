# interactive_programming
Software Design project on interactive data visualization, focused on sociolinguistics (slang by geographic area in the US) over time

To start, clone a local copy of the repo. 

	>>> git clone https://github.com/ctada/interactive_programming.git

Examples are available in the /Html folder. In this case, maps showing different data sets (i.e. time spent outdoors and frequency of smiling, on a scale of 1-5 for both) have already been generated as html files. Run index.html.
	
	>>> cd interactive_programming/Html
	>>> firefox index.html

To edit the data source or process different information, move back to the root project foloder and open Interactive_Visualization_Map_Project.py in your word processor of choice (gedit shown here). This file is what generates the map. 

	>>> cd .. 
	>>> gedit Interactive_Visualization_Map_Project.py

For further documentation, open documentation.html from the root folder. 

	>>> firefox documentation.html
